# Year2-Project

My UCL second year project themed on Physical Applied Mathematics - 2D vortex dynamics - Smooth vortex solutions.
The specific project focused on symmetric dipole solutions.

Expected outcome: Mathematically describe the symmetric dipole solution of the 2-dimensional Euler equations
